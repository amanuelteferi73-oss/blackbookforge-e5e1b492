## Technical Implementation

### Files to Create

1. **`src/lib/floorWeek5Data.ts`** — Week 5 content: Marketing Blitz
2. **`src/lib/floorWeek6Data.ts`** — Week 6 content: Dual-Track Execution
3. **`src/lib/floorWeek7Data.ts`** — Week 7 content: Investor & Revenue

### Files to Modify

1. **`src/hooks/useFloor.ts`**
   - Import the 3 new week data files
   - Add them to the `ALL_WEEKS` array

2. **`src/components/floor/WeekSelector.tsx`**
   - Add new titles to `WEEK_TITLES` mapping:
     - 5: "Marketing Blitz & Outreach Domination"
     - 6: "Dual-Track Execution"
     - 7: "Investor Outreach & First Revenue"
   - Remove placeholder for week 5

### No Backend Changes Required

The existing `floor_weeks` and `floor_days` tables already support the new weeks. The initialization logic in `useFloor.ts` will automatically create the new weeks when the user loads The Floor.

## Summary

This plan maintains the exact same structure, appearance, and philosophy of The Floor while adding 3 aggressive new weeks focused on:

- **Week 5:** Pure marketing volume (3,500+ emails)
- **Week 6:** Dual-track with web dev services reactivation
- **Week 7:** Investor outreach + first revenue target ($100+)
